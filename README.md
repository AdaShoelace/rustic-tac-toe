# rustic-tac-toe
The goal here is for you to implement a `board_checker` in an existing, half-finished, tic-tac-toe game.  
In order to see the end goal run `cargo run --features="test"` from inside this directory.  
To test your own solution simply run `cargo run`. At first this will crash upon the initial board check since you have not yet implented a `board_checker`.  
  
 So start implementing `check()`inside `my_checker.rs` and if you have any questions please ask!

## Install rust
If you do not have rust installed already, go to [the homepage](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions.

Else run `rustup update` in your terminal.

## Editor
I do recommend using Visual Studio code since this is the easiest to set up.
So install VScode and install a plugin called *RLS* and you should be good to go!
